## 💼 Professional (Game) Projects

In addition to my personal and experimental projects, I have been fortunate to contribute to several exciting professional game titles:

- [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/home)  
  *Sandbox Interactive, 2018*  
  I worked on this MMORPG for six months, where I helped develop the initial "Seasons" feature—an innovative competitive system for guilds—as well as the fishing feature, which brought new depth to the game’s economy and player activities.

- [Survival City](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.survivalcity)  
  *PlayStack, iOS & Android*  
  This mobile survival and strategy game was my main focus for over six years. I progressed to lead programmer, overseeing feature development, team collaboration, and the technical direction that delivered a rich, engaging experience for players on both iOS and Android platforms.

- [Super Dashmatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/750420/Super_Dashmatch/)  
  *Student Project*  
  As a student, I contributed to this competitive local multiplayer game, which launched in Early Access on Steam. While the project never made it past EA, it was a valuable learning experience in rapid prototyping, gameplay balancing, and teamwork within a multidisciplinary team.

These projects reflect not just my technical skills, but also my commitment to delivering memorable player experiences and my growth as a collaborative developer and leader in the games industry.

## 🌟 Side Projects

While most of my professional work is private, I occasionally create public projects for fun, learning, or to explore new technologies.  
Here are a couple of examples from my GitHub:

- [Modulith-Learning](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/Modulith-Learning) – A playground for learning modulithic architecture, combining .NET Web API and GraphQL (using HotChocolate).
- [Simple-CRUD-Learning](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/Simple-CRUD-Learning) – A simple .NET Web API CRUD application for enhanced inventory management using onion layer architecture.
- [SimpleK8](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/Simple-K8) – A simple Kubernetes-related project.
- [PacMan Learning](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/PacMan-Learning) – Experimenting with AI and classic games.
- [piratebattleships](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/piratebattleships) – My first game ever, built with the .NET Framework 3.5 using WinForms 😅, back in 2010. This repo is archived and kept for nostalgia ☺️.

These repos are not actively maintained, but they showcase my curiosity and my love for building things in my spare time!
