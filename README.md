## 🌟 Side Projects

While most of my professional work is private, I occasionally create public projects for fun, learning, or to explore new technologies.  
Here are a couple of examples from my GitHub:

- [Modulith-Learning](https://github.com/ChaosHelme/Modulith-Learning) – A playground for learning modulithic architecture, combining .NET Web API and GraphQL (using HotChocolate).
